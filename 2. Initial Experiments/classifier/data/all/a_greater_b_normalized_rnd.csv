Every so often, some of our academic colleagues wax lyrical about OBJECT_A apps and their rich functionality and/or ease of use for areas of content creation in which we're interested - podcasting, audio/video/image editing and upload, recording, etc. It'll be interesting to see whether Macs offer better or easier solutions than OBJECT_B for some kinds of content creation.;A_GREATER_B
while roughly 100 vulnerabilities have been revealed in Mac OBJECT_A this year, this is still dwarfed by those in OBJECT_B mainly because of Apple's automatic updating software;A_GREATER_B
No actually I gave up with the OBJECT_B version cause none of the buttons had writing on them unless I moved my mouse over them :S The OBJECT_A version of 2.25 renders far better than the 2.23 version,but is just as slow... I've got a 1.2MB .blend;A_GREATER_B
The facts are that the D600 has been crippled as a serious video tool, and in that respect falls far behind the OBJECT_A lineup, which is a huge pity because I was looking forward to putting my OBJECT_B glass on it and not having to buy a OBJECT_A camera (I don't like them as stills cameras).;A_GREATER_B
It is quite possible that even if a Mac OBJECT_A system were also tested, that the OBJECT_B system would score higher, despite Mac OBJECT_A having better usability, strictly speaking.;A_GREATER_B
One could argue that OBJECT_B is even worse in this regard because it zoom to fullscreen with maximize but this is only a very weak consolation and I'm talking about OBJECT_A only here anyway.;A_GREATER_B
What Apple is betting on is that the user experience on Mac OBJECT_A is enough better that, when users get to try  OBJECT_A and OBJECT_B side-by-side, they'll prefer  OBJECT_A.;A_GREATER_B
"DCI reviews the OBJECT_A EOS 450D/Digital Rebel XSi and writes; ""it has more resolution than the A200 and produces overall better quality images than the OBJECT_B D60.";A_GREATER_B
"In most ways, OBJECT_A is superior to OBJECT_B XP.""";A_GREATER_B
OBJECT_B would have also been a good choice but IMO it is an inferior language compared to OBJECT_A ;A_GREATER_B
I now notice things about OBJECT_B that would have never bothered me before, because OBJECT_A is just so perfect compared to OBJECT_B ;A_GREATER_B
I'd like to say it was because i liked OBJECT_A over OBJECT_B but for me it was simple economics.;A_GREATER_B
like i said i use linux and have worked on HPC installations and have used the ubiquitous OBJECT_B but i will not shy away from the fact that OBJECT_A is superior.;A_GREATER_B
But then we'll need better security in Linux and OBJECT_A (both of which are apparently already far more secure than OBJECT_B but do have vulnerabilities).;A_GREATER_B
They love OBJECT_A because it's nice and shiny and 'just works' and hate OBJECT_B because it's far from shiny and is still fraught with problems left and right.;A_GREATER_B
"With OBJECT_B your required to re-install every 12 months or so because it gets so bogged down and slow; but on OBJECT_A you just don't do that, you don't need to.";A_GREATER_B
you might want to consider lens offered from each manufacture... there are pro's and cons to each... depending on what you are looking for, they 'can' cost more than the camera and impact the body used... OBJECT_A lenses are thought to be better than the OBJECT_B nikor's...;A_GREATER_B
I really hate small characters looking purple and green on OBJECT_B much more than a little fuzziness on OBJECT_A Adobe Flash has even worse sub-pixel rendering then cleartype.;A_GREATER_B
This could be because OBJECT_A is a more secure system, or simply because there are so few Macs in relation to OBJECT_B PCs that malicious programmers don't bother targeting the Mac OS.;A_GREATER_B
I'd come to the conclusion OBJECT_A was 'better' than most(certainly php, probably OBJECT_B and javascript because is not well supported server-side), but i could not have said why as succinctly as you have.;A_GREATER_B
