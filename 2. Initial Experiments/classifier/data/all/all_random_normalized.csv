So, to sum it up...go to the store, pick up a OBJECT_A OBJECT_B and Sony in the price range you like, and play with them a little, see which fits in your hands better, and which has more intuitive menu system for you, see how you like the optical vs electronic VF, and of course, see which one is easier to change basic settings.;NO_COMP

Yes, OBJECT_B has better dynamic range at ISO 100, but above ISO 1000, where it really starts to matter, OBJECT_A actually takes over (only slightly, but consistently.);NO_COMP
Notice that OBJECT_B like Perl, but unlike OBJECT_A does not need to map the trailing newline because the OBJECT_B raw_input function removes it.;NO_COMP
"When I learned a few years ago that Mac OBJECT_A was essentially a distribution of Unix (and subsequently ""defected"" from the wretched world of OBJECT_B , I began the transition to needing to use different (and often superior) softwares for my work.";NO_COMP
Now that OBJECT_B has a huge bucket of competing solutions, some arguably superior, especially in ORMs, the draw of OBJECT_A vs OBJECT_B seems to have been drastically reduced.;A_LESSER_B
1) People move to OBJECT_A because OBJECT_B including 7, has more problems and nuisances than I care to mention.;A_GREATER_B
"So what is it about the OBJECT_B D70 or D80 (both supposedly better than what I'm using now) or a pro OBJECT_A camera that makes them ""better"" cameras?";NO_COMP
Why the rumored D800 delay IS OBJECT_B and NR's fault is because they turn civilized people to think irrationally and make impulsive moves like switching to OBJECT_A ;NO_COMP
I know OBJECT_B better than OBJECT_A but I still work much faster with OBJECT_A ;NO_COMP
I quickly found that the OBJECT_B fitted in my hand considerably better than the OBJECT_A (D50 vs 350D) so I went with OBJECT_B for that single reason.;A_LESSER_B
Despite the better image quality of the OBJECT_B system, I decided to go with the OBJECT_A ;NO_COMP
As said before OBJECT_A have always been better priced than the OBJECT_B so hopefully this will continue.;A_GREATER_B
"that is: ""OBJECT_B (or OBJECT_A can ""something"", but php cann't this, so, php is worse!""";NO_COMP
Many other languages (just like OBJECT_B or OBJECT_A , have become popular with a tagline Obsoleting Perl"", because they all thought a replacement was desperately needed.";A_LESSER_B
DLR-based implementations of OBJECT_A and OBJECT_B should be better suited to that purpose.;NO_COMP
For instance C# is a much bigger success than Objective C because OBJECT_B XP is a much bigger success than Mac OBJECT_A ;A_LESSER_B
I would stick with OBJECT_A or OBJECT_B because they have the best selection of lenses.;NO_COMP
This'd help a lot with OBJECT_B machine that currently need a cd rom to get the two things co-operating, while OBJECT_A and Linux are more conveniant in that they have the drivers built in, OBJECT_A moreso because they employ people to write the drivers that hardware companies should but aren't.;A_GREATER_B
And then, to fully emulate the Mac netbook experience - because I'm not interested in a tiny laptop if it's running OBJECT_B - I installed Mac OBJECT_A on the thing.;NO_COMP
I did not go with a OBJECT_B DSLR because I also wanted to use the camera for video and OBJECT_A seemed to be superior in that department.;A_GREATER_B
There is a good need for such tools because proxies are quite complex and not trivial to write even if you choose to use a high-level language such as Java, OBJECT_B or OBJECT_A ;NO_COMP

I think the browsers are calling an OS routine to do the scaling and Mac OBJECT_A just has better scaling routines than OBJECT_B Linux (although I have not tried Vista).;A_GREATER_B
Of course, after making the switch, many OBJECT_B users end up finding suitable--or superior--OBJECT_A replacements for their favorite software, and become full-time Mac OBJECT_A users.;A_GREATER_B

Come on now, just because hardcore gaming is my predominant on the OBJECT_B platform, doesn't mean you should exclude other mobile platforms such as OBJECT_A or Android/Chrome.;NO_COMP
One of the reasons I chose OBJECT_B over OBJECT_A is because it isn't a TIMTOWTDI language.;A_LESSER_B
For 30k you can take your photography a step further just with a parabolic umbrella, or HMI's or better post production and by the time the S2 is on the shelf does anyone really believe that OBJECT_A and OBJECT_B won't have something out there in the 30mpx area as well.;NO_COMP
Yeah, I know I should program in Java or OBJECT_B or OBJECT_A or Kotlin or something else because it is obviously way cooler ... but I don't.;NO_COMP
In other words, Parrot has certain features because the OBJECT_B & OBJECT_A folks needed them, and these will require Perl to adapt if it wants to take advantage.;NO_COMP
It is easier to find OBJECT_A to OBJECT_B adaptors than OBJECT_A FD/EF adaptors, and without glass they work a lot better.;NO_COMP
Actually I use macs because I just like the OBJECT_A UI and such better, and OBJECT_A has Unix-like stuff under the hood that I already know how to use rather than OBJECT_B NT-based stuff that I don't know much about and don't like based on what little I do know about it.;A_GREATER_B
Even though it is web-based, the remote access interface requires OBJECT_B Explorer 6 or better, which is not supported on Mac OBJECT_A 4 While this is somewhat subjective, it indicates a general ability to access the functionality from a Mac.;NO_COMP
OBJECT_B has been around significantly longer than OBJECT_A & with Google's embrace of the language, OBJECT_B s documentation has gotten noticeably better during the last few years.;A_LESSER_B
I also need to take a better look at how OBJECT_A or OBJECT_B handle this type of thing.;NO_COMP
"Developers will NOT stop supporting Mac OBJECT_A because ""Mac users can just run OBJECT_B """;NO_COMP
"You get to dual-boot Mac OBJECT_A the superior #1 operating system, and OBJECT_B the OS people use to play The Sims. ""You actually receive ""joy"" from using OS 10? Wow.";A_GREATER_B
Plus you run into problems when the abstractions get leaky because you're not really writing OBJECT_B (or OBJECT_A or what have you).;NO_COMP
While Mac OBJECT_A has the advantage of having a port of Microsoft Office (and a better one than the OBJECT_B version IMO), it also has the advantage of having access to the wonderful world of open source software.;A_GREATER_B
I kind of like the OBJECT_B language better and it seems to be more full-featured than OBJECT_A for statistical, scientific and networking (let me know if you think this is wrong).;A_LESSER_B
Long time photographers with a collection of lenses and perhaps a fondness for manual focus will find the Sony A7 and A7R incredibly versatile cameras because you can use a variety of lenses including Leica M, OBJECT_A and OBJECT_B full frame lenses with these two Sony cameras.;NO_COMP

I think Heather had a good point about being able to get help for a OBJECT_A or OBJECT_B because they are more popular.;NO_COMP
OBJECT_B somehow dominates over Mac OBJECT_A yet there is no argument that could be made that OBJECT_B is a better OS than OBJECT_A ;NO_COMP
I thought the triple-boot install order was 1. OBJECT_A 2. linux 3. OBJECT_B I know it must work because I just installed ubuntu netbook edition with grub on the /boot partition, and I could boot it in chameleon.;NO_COMP
Eh, I looked, none of those links are really helpful, especially because I'm on OBJECT_A not OBJECT_B ;NO_COMP
The Shading graphs of Figure 7 indicate that the OBJECT_B 14mm f/2.8 values are about three times (worse) than those of the OBJECT_A ;A_GREATER_B

The new operating system also features improvements under the hood designed to bolster its Unix underpinnings and to allow Mac OBJECT_A systems to fit in better on OBJECT_B dominated corporate networks.;NO_COMP
The only stumbling block is that £549 would also buy such newcomers a decent entry level DSLR, such as a OBJECT_B D5100 or OBJECT_A EOS 1100D , with standard 18-55mm zoom and arguably better image quality - that's if the GF3's much smaller form factor isn't the over-riding consideration.;NO_COMP
I've used it to write single-page programs that perform better than what would take three days and 13 third-party libraries in C or C++, and wouldn't even be possible in OBJECT_B C#, OBJECT_A etc.;NO_COMP
On a case insensitive file system (such as the standard file systems for Mac OBJECT_A and OBJECT_B , the SCM gets seriously confused because it is made to believe there are to files but the file system can only store one of them at a time.;NO_COMP
To make sense it has to not just be better but significantly better - these MF cameras are far less user friendly (and indeed functional) than the state of the art from OBJECT_A OBJECT_B m(live view, high ISO, wide apertures, user interface).;NO_COMP
I love OBJECT_B because the system feels better to me, but OBJECT_A makes a great product also.;A_LESSER_B
Since this software is available on UNIX (which Mac OBJECT_A is built on) and also on OBJECT_B (Intel hardware), is the Apple switch to Intel-based hardware going to better my chances for a MacOS CAD workstation, or will it remain a pipedream?;NO_COMP
Mac OBJECT_A has astonishingly better multimedia performance than OBJECT_B XP.;A_GREATER_B
It's worth mentioning that the record result of 50 lpmm was something we were expecting up to a point because the Olympus E-510, having 10 Mpix on a small 4:3 sensor, is much more densely pixel-packed than e.g. a OBJECT_B D200 or a OBJECT_A 20D.;NO_COMP
But If all us believe that OBJECT_B or OBJECT_A are better than PHP, we must all agree with the fact that PHP deployment is completely gracefully and painless.;NO_COMP

In uncompiled languages (OBJECT_A OBJECT_B etc), we can provide better syntaxes which make for more readable code.;NO_COMP
I guess that OBJECT_B just try to push the FX sales because there are not so many competitors at the moment (OBJECT_A Sony, Leica) whereas APS and smaller are flooded with interesting cameras and more competitors (Fuji, Olympus, Panasonic, Samsung, Pentax...).;NO_COMP

files (divx or xvid) in OBJECT_B (95/98/NT/2000/XP/Vista), Linux/BSD/UNIX or OBJECT_A BananaSplitter works across all these platforms because it's written in Java, so you will need to have Java installed.;NO_COMP
This is a problem for languages like OBJECT_A OBJECT_B PHP, Perl, and others because in many cases extensions, libraries, and plugins for these languages are loaded by the VM using libdl.;NO_COMP
Firstly, it would be appropriate if OBJECT_B showed something new, something of the OBJECT_A 10-22 mm class, with a similar range and similar or even better optical properties.;NO_COMP
Lastly think about those who don't complain but just give up and leave, From past few years OBJECT_A and OBJECT_B scored some undeserved points because of all this FUD.;NO_COMP
The default I posted is 'film standard' ... I've processed literally thousands of images with this converter and rarely found nature or wildlife shots that looked better with the flatter settings, so that's probably why OBJECT_B and OBJECT_A (and Capture One) bias the settings that way.;NO_COMP
Apple customers pay this premium because they think the melding of great hardware with Apple's solid software (OBJECT_A and iLife) is worth it over a OBJECT_B based machine.;NO_COMP
So I hope to pull that discussion over here because it's about Smalltalk vs. OBJECT_A not about OBJECT_B vs. OBJECT_A ;NO_COMP
I sold my OBJECT_B 70-200mm f/2.8 VR lens and picked up the OBJECT_A 70-200mm f/4L non-IS (I never used VR/IS on that lens anyways), like the OBJECT_A f/4 a whole lot better, and the difference in price paid for half of the 5D2 body!;A_GREATER_B
This is because neither the PW or YN use exactly the same signalling as OBJECT_A & OBJECT_B ;NO_COMP
I may actually be somewhat of an oddity because I am mostly a landscape and architecture photographer and it seems to me many people chose OBJECT_B as their camera of choice if that is what they shoot, but I guess I started with OBJECT_A and will probably stay there unless someone gives me a stable of OBJECT_B gear.;NO_COMP
The profs use Macs so I'm pretty sure whatever we learnt can be done on a Mac just as well as a PC - only problem being that having a OBJECT_A or Unix is better than OBJECT_B because we had to use an emulation program and it doesn't always show the right results.;NO_COMP
I don't believe price can be an order of magnitude better (at least while Mac OBJECT_A is a differentiator for a slim line of hardware platforms, and while the effective cost of MS OBJECT_B is effectively zero for bundled deals).;NO_COMP
The OBJECT_A 1dx and 5d3 jpegs look so much better than OBJECT_B d4 and d800 jpegs.;A_GREATER_B

"Also, it's moot for me as I'm not running OBJECT_B right now; I don't think similar functionality exists on OBJECT_A Linux might be better, but unfortunately it's not an option as I then couldn't run OBJECT_A at least not without dual-booting, and I've become too used to VMs to do that.]";NO_COMP
I wonder if the OBJECT_B camp complains about AF & ISO or FPS?  OBJECT_A will eventually have better sensors, and OBJECT_B will eventually have better AF.;NO_COMP
OBJECT_B user wanting to make the switch Well, a better solution would be to use MS Office for Mac OBJECT_A ;NO_COMP
Perhaps due to their high market penetration, or maybe because of poor coding, Adobe Flash [2] and Java have emerged as the two most widely attacked platforms on OBJECT_B Mac OBJECT_A and Linux alike.;NO_COMP
That's because OBJECT_B or Mac OBJECT_A will require you to run out and spend $$$$ on the latest version of the OS, or buy a freaking new computer.;NO_COMP
