Arguments please, the only OO-related thing that I saw could be considered superior in OBJECT_A 1.8 (compared to OBJECT_B 2.4) is the handling of properties...;A_GREATER_B
Even Mac OBJECT_A 10.3 is still better than recent OBJECT_B versions.;A_GREATER_B
I've tried OBJECT_B and can see why people like it, but OBJECT_A suits my style better.;A_GREATER_B
OBJECT_A decided not to just bring out a competitor, but hit OBJECT_B hard with something better in terms of resolution.;A_GREATER_B
And I have to agree with most of what you are saying - I don't have a 5d3 for AF speed comparison - but for skin tones the OBJECT_A is a lot better for me than the OBJECT_B (I owned the D700 most recently but also shot with the D300 for a couple of years and have worked with the D3x at times).;A_GREATER_B
@ Timbukto, i am a OBJECT_B user now but have been using OBJECT_A till last summer and i must say the OOC jpegs looks way better from OBJECT_A because of the higher default sharpening and contrast levels , and you ar not gaining much in that respect if you shoot raw .;A_GREATER_B
"We suspect that Safari 4 does better under OBJECT_A however, so the poor OBJECT_B result probably won't matter to most Safari users.'""";A_GREATER_B

I sold my OBJECT_B 70-200mm f/2.8 VR lens and picked up the OBJECT_A 70-200mm f/4L non-IS (I never used VR/IS on that lens anyways), like the OBJECT_A f/4 a whole lot better, and the difference in price paid for half of the 5D2 body!;A_GREATER_B
"OBJECT_A has an arguably better user experience than OBJECT_B and it's ""teh pretty"".";A_GREATER_B
give it a year or so and you'll see everything running a lot faster on OBJECT_A it's like, if MS decided to port OBJECT_B to PowerPC platform. of course no applications would run at native speed from the beginning because they wouldn't be simply compiled for that particular hardware.;A_GREATER_B
"However, there is a cost savings long-term because they won't have to spend additional money fighting viruses; replacing faulty boards and monitors and the OBJECT_A operating system is more robust than OBJECT_B or other systems.";A_GREATER_B
I switched to OBJECT_B a few years ago but had to go back to OBJECT_A simply because OBJECT_B doesn't have an equivalent of this 135L.;A_GREATER_B
All in all, I usually prefer OBJECT_A to OBJECT_B because I love OBJECT_A s metaprogramming support .;A_GREATER_B
right before the table starts falling out for OBJECT_A DR (of course with OBJECT_B I'd had already traded away two stops, maybe OBJECT_A is better, I didn't lose two stops going ISO100 to ISO400 ).;A_GREATER_B
Unless you want to trade 24-105 OBJECT_A for OBJECT_B 24-120 F/4, which many people these days like over 24-70, because OBJECT_B 24-70 is just too damn heavy.;A_GREATER_B
OBJECT_A teaches you to use lambdas right out of the box while in OBJECT_B they're considered advanced play because of the awful (magical) syntax for creating them.;A_GREATER_B

I think you'd be better off buying a OBJECT_A like the 8800F, 8600F, 9950F etc for a lot less, then the extra £200+ you would have otherwise spent on the V700/750 put that towards a OBJECT_B Coolscan for your slides etc.;A_GREATER_B
With new OBJECT_B bodies being kind of disappointing (let's be honest - 1Dx looks much better than D4 and D800 is a camera that not only a fraction of OBJECT_B users are waiting for right now), I guess many of us will face the moment when we'll think of switching to OBJECT_A ;A_GREATER_B
There's also a point to be made on how well Fuji listens to customers while OBJECT_B really takes the bottom rating on that front with OBJECT_A somewhat better.;A_GREATER_B
Unfortunately, this seems to work better with Linux/Unix systems than with OBJECT_B or OBJECT_A ;A_GREATER_B
I did better with my OBJECT_A but the OBJECT_B is a little trickier.;A_GREATER_B
These past years, we've seen a lot of photographers switching from OBJECT_A to OBJECT_B .. but I met two French photographers who recently moved from the OBJECT_B D800 to the OBJECT_A EOS 5D Mark III because of a more versatile body and finally a better camera for most of their use.;A_GREATER_B
I also think OBJECT_B is a good choice because it is similarly very easy, but I think its much less fun because it lacks the beautiful synchronicity of OBJECT_A ;A_GREATER_B
While Mac OBJECT_A has the advantage of having a port of Microsoft Office (and a better one than the OBJECT_B version IMO), it also has the advantage of having access to the wonderful world of open source software.;A_GREATER_B
"The only things OBJECT_B have going for it are a comprehensive library, ""better than OBJECT_A " performance, and mindshare.";A_GREATER_B
Also, the DNS Service plug-in part that offers Bonjour network discovery now purportedly works much better on Mac OBJECT_A and OBJECT_B ;A_GREATER_B
Of course, after making the switch, many OBJECT_B users end up finding suitable--or superior- OBJECT_A replacements for their favorite software, and become full-time Mac OBJECT_A users.;A_GREATER_B
The 6D doesn't shoot quite as fast as the OBJECT_B D600-it's about one frame per second slower-but the addition of Wi-Fi and GPS and superior image quality at high ISO settings give OBJECT_A the edge.;A_GREATER_B
They also make the same lenses in OBJECT_B mount versions... Do they work better for OBJECT_A versus the ones that work on OBJECT_B bodies?;A_GREATER_B
Actually I use macs because I just like the OBJECT_A UI and such better, and OBJECT_A has Unix-like stuff under the hood that I already know how to use rather than OBJECT_B NT-based stuff that I don't know much about and don't like based on what little I do know about it.;A_GREATER_B
OBJECT_A has almost eliminated all of its' 32 bit code, so it has problems now with older 32 bit apps., but will be faster and better than OBJECT_B for NOW, once the programs catch up and they release real 64 bit programs.;A_GREATER_B
The problems with OBJECT_B Vista and the extended life of OBJECT_B XP proved an opportunity for Apple, which was able to offer a better user experience and fewer security headaches with the Unix-like Mac OBJECT_A ;A_GREATER_B

The standards-compliant Safari on Mac OBJECT_A and Firefox on numerous platforms often work better with these sites than does Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) Internet Explorer on OBJECT_B ;A_GREATER_B
I will only buy OBJECT_A gear , no more trying out any other brand , OBJECT_B , on paper , is truly amaizng but in real life use OBJECT_A is better , BTW, I think OBJECT_B manu system sucks and the D40X is a real silly camera what a shocking surprise is it?;A_GREATER_B
And, the manual focus on OBJECT_A L lenses is superior to OBJECT_B IME;A_GREATER_B
And by the way, included software and protection from virus attacks are crucial and those features alone make Snow Leopard (and all versions of OBJECT_A vastly superior to OBJECT_B 7.;A_GREATER_B
But I always end up coming back to OBJECT_A because I like things to just work and I find OBJECT_A far, far more intuitive than any version of OBJECT_B I've encountered - and I've encountered them all.;A_GREATER_B
If the whole point of the appeal of Mac OBJECT_A is that Mac software is better than OBJECT_B software - or at least better in the eyes of one segment of the market - what possible good would it do Apple to help that software run on OBJECT_B too?;A_GREATER_B
I have read about the beauty of OBJECT_A and how it's better than OBJECT_B or Perl.;A_GREATER_B
Rob Pegoraro: A Mac would be well-suited for those uses--it's got better Internet software built-in than any OBJECT_B machine, and Microsoft Office for Mac OBJECT_A is very easy to switch to from Office for OBJECT_B (it's also much better than pre-2007 versions of Office for OBJECT_B .;A_GREATER_B
let the marketing games begin!  no question that 7D is still very succesful, so maybe OBJECT_A feels that a little kick in the pants and they can ride this train even longer to better position them to compete with the next OBJECT_B offering.;A_GREATER_B
The F/4 line is what OBJECT_A has done better but OBJECT_B is only a 70-200 away from completing that.;A_GREATER_B

"[Actually, I recommend suggesting to people that if they can't handle Linux, that they switch to OBJECT_A - since it's superior to OBJECT_B and will probably be as easy (perhaps easier) for such people to use as OBJECT_B would; and it would tend to help weaken, not strengthen, MS's monopoly.]";A_GREATER_B

If there is some measurement DxO is using that shows xxx lens on a D800 allows it to rate higher then they need to show that test/score - because of the scores they 'do' provide clearly show the OBJECT_A performing better...
